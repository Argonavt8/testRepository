Speak at GitHub Universe: three weeks left to submit proposals:
[![universe](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2515203/26126518/dc4f3ad2-3a53-11e7-9794-d84b40dbaf60.jpg "Univers")](https://github.com/blog/2394-speak-at-github-universe-three-weeks-left-to-submit-proposals)

GitHub Universe is returning to San Francisco this fall, 
and we're looking for new voices to lead our breakout sessions.

Your stories are unique, and having lived them, 
you're the best person to share your insights with others.

If you're new to speaking, don't let that stop you.

With our submission deadline approaching on July 28, 
we're inviting you to share your session idea with us.

How to make your speaker proposal stand out
-------------------------------------------
Here are some tips to keep in mind as you refine your speaker proposal.

Put your audience first and second
----------------------------------
Identify who can benefit most from your story. Even if it’s a first-person experience, tell it to those individuals in a way that helps them connect with it.
Make them feel like they’re a part of your experience by framing it in terms of   similar experiences they might have and what they can do with the information you’re sharing.
